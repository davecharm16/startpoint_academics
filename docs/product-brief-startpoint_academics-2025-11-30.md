# Product Brief: Startpoint Academics

**Date:** 2025-11-30
**Author:** Dave
**Context:** Startup/Solopreneur - Service Business Platform

---

## Executive Summary

Startpoint Academics is a platform that streamlines academic writing services operations by connecting clients with writers through an efficient, transparent workflow. The platform solves the operational chaos of running an academic services business - eliminating manual payment calculations, incomplete client briefs, and the constant "status check" messages that consume time.

The core innovation is **transparency-first operations**: public pricing without forced registration, complete client briefs before writer assignment, real-time progress visibility for all parties, and automated 60/40 profit splitting.

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Operational platform for current business
**Phase 2:** Public marketplace with freelancer onboarding

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Running an academic writing services business today involves painful manual processes that don't scale:

1. **Writers chase clients for details** - Clients provide incomplete information, forcing writers to repeatedly follow up before they can start work. This delays projects and frustrates everyone.

2. **Payment calculations are manual and error-prone** - Tracking who earned what on each project, calculating the 60/40 split, and reconciling payments happens in spreadsheets that become unmanageable as volume grows.

3. **Clients are left in the dark** - Without visibility into project progress, clients constantly message asking "what's the status?" - consuming admin time that could be spent growing the business.

4. **No professional client acquisition flow** - Sharing pricing requires manual explanations; there's no easy way to send a link and have clients self-select packages and provide requirements.

5. **Admin overhead grows with each client** - Every new project means more manual coordination, more status updates, more payment tracking. The business can't scale without proportional headache increase.

### Problem Impact

- **Writer productivity loss:** Hours spent chasing client details instead of writing
- **Admin time drain:** Manual payment calculations, status update conversations, pricing explanations
- **Client experience:** Uncertainty and lack of transparency erodes trust and repeat business
- **Growth ceiling:** Current manual processes limit how many clients can be served without burning out

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| Generic project management tools (Trello, Asana) | Not designed for client-writer-admin workflows; no payment splitting |
| Freelance marketplaces (Fiverr, Upwork) | Take large commissions; don't support team profit sharing; public exposure unwanted initially |
| Manual spreadsheets + messaging apps | Doesn't scale; no client visibility; error-prone payment tracking |
| Custom enterprise solutions | Overkill complexity and cost for a growing service business |

### Proposed Solution

**Startpoint Academics** - A purpose-built platform for academic writing service operations that:

1. **Eliminates incomplete briefs** - Configurable intake forms capture everything writers need upfront. Package selection determines required fields. No project starts without complete information.

2. **Automates the money** - When a project is marked complete and paid, the system automatically calculates the 60/40 split. Weekly/monthly profit dashboards show earnings at a glance.

3. **Creates transparency for all** - Clients see real-time progress updates. Writers see their assignments and earnings. Admin sees everything in one dashboard.

4. **Enables zero-friction client onboarding** - Shareable package links let clients browse pricing without registration, select their package, and submit complete project requirements in one flow.

5. **Scales without proportional pain** - As client volume grows, the platform handles coordination, visibility, and calculations automatically.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Transparency-first** - No hidden pricing, no forced registration, real-time visibility for all parties
2. **Writer-protective** - Complete briefs before assignment; writers never chase clients for details
3. **Zero-friction sharing** - Shareable package links for instant client onboarding
4. **Automated financials** - 60/40 split calculated automatically; no spreadsheets
5. **Purpose-built** - Designed specifically for academic writing service operations, not adapted from generic tools

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must-Have for Launch)

| # | Feature | Description | User Benefit |
|---|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Landing Page** | Professional public page with services, packages, pricing, testimonials, trust signals | Clients find and trust the service |
| 2 | **Shareable Package Links** | Unique URLs for each pricing tier; no registration required to view | Zero-friction client acquisition |

| 5 | **Client Progress View** | Status tracking (Assigned → In Progress → Review → Complete) | Clients stay informed |
| 6 | **Admin Dashboard** | Active projects, writer assignments, payment tracker with 60/40 split | Business visibility and automation |

### MVP Critical Path

```
Landing Page → Package Links → Intake Form → Writer Assignment → Progress Updates → File Delivery → Payment Split
```

### Out of Scope for MVP

These features are valuable but not required for initial launch:

| Feature | Why Deferred | Bridge Solution |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| File upload/download | Adds complexity | Use Google Drive links initially |
| In-platform messaging | Not core to value prop | Use email/WhatsApp for communication |
| Automated writer assignment | Manual works at current scale | Admin assigns manually |
| Writer earnings dashboard | Nice-to-have for writers | Writers can ask admin for earnings |
| Client authentication/login | Single project tracking sufficient | Each project gets unique tracking link |
| Payment gateway integration | Complex, regulatory considerations | Manual payment collection initially |

### Future Vision (Phase 1.5 and Phase 2)

**Phase 1.5 - Post-MVP Enhancements:**
- File upload/download system within platform
- Integrated messaging per project
- Writer earnings dashboard
- Automated writer assignment based on availability

**Phase 2 - Marketplace Expansion:**
- AI Chatbot for intake and lead generation (the triple-purpose tool: marketing + intake + writer protection)
- Public freelancer marketplace
- Freelancer onboarding and vetting system
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Rating and review system
- Subscription packages for ongoing client relationships

## Technical Preferences

### Platform Considerations

- **Web-first** - Primary interface is web browser (desktop and mobile responsive)
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add features incrementally
- **Modern stack** - Technology choices to be determined in Architecture phase

### Integration Needs

| Integration | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Email notifications | MVP | Project confirmations, status updates |
| Google Drive | MVP Bridge | File sharing until in-platform solution |
| WhatsApp/SMS | Optional | Status notifications (nice-to-have) |
| Payment gateway | Phase 1.5 | Stripe, PayPal, or local options |
| AI/Chatbot | Phase 2 | Lead generation and intake automation |

### Data Requirements

- Project records (client info, requirements, status, payments)
- Writer assignments and workload
- Financial tracking (package prices, payments, 60/40 splits)
- Progress history per project

---

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

1. **Writers will adopt the platform** - Assumption that writers will use the dashboard rather than reverting to messaging
2. **Clients value transparency** - Assumption that progress visibility is a differentiator worth building
3. **60/40 split is sustainable** - Current business model assumption
4. **Volume justifies platform** - Assumption that current/projected client volume warrants building vs. manual processes

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Writers resist new workflow | High | Involve writers in feedback; make it clearly easier than current process |
| Clients don't use tracking | Medium | Send proactive notifications; make tracking link prominent |
| Technical complexity exceeds capacity | High | Start with MVP; use proven technologies; iterate based on feedback |
| Legal/compliance concerns with academic services | Medium | Clear terms of service; position as "academic support" appropriately |

### Open Questions for PRD Phase

1. What are the exact packages and pricing tiers?
2. How will payments be collected initially (before payment gateway)?
3. What's the exact intake form field structure per package?
4. How should progress milestones be structured?
5. What notifications should be sent and when?
